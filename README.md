# Expression Parser

A tiny Node.js expression parser library designed to be embedded in other ZiftrShop projects.

It contains no external dependencies at runtime and compiles and compresses to less than 3kb

There is an emphasizes simplicity over performance since expressions are not called often and do not need to be fast.

See tests folder for examples. Or [the workflows page on confluence](https://airtank.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENGINEERIN/pages/135692289/Workflows#Filters).
